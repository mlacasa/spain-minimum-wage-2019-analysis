# Replication Package for "The Impact of Minimum Wage Increases on Employment and Income Distribution in Spain"

This repository contains the full code and raw data required to replicate the analysis presented in the paper, "The Impact of Minimum Wage Increases on Employment and Income Distribution in Spain" by Marcos Lacasa-Cazcarra.

## Abstract

This paper evaluates the employment and distributional effects of Spain's 22% minimum wage increase in 2019, using administrative data on all formal-sector workers. Our difference-in-differences analysis reveals that while aggregate employment remained resilient, the reform caused a persistent 14% decline in youth employment relative to its counterfactual trajectory. This large negative effect, masked by aggregate statistics, proves descriptive claims of a "recovery" are misleading.

Furthermore, the reform had perverse distributional consequences. Counterfactual simulations show it paradoxically worsened inequality, raising the Gini coefficient by 0.20% as employment losses among the poorest youth dominated the wage gains of incumbent workers. Our results show how a confluence of a large hike, extreme labor market dualism, and high pre-existing vulnerability created a severe employment barrier. This case demonstrates that in segmented markets, aggressive, uniform wage hikes can deepen the inequality they intend to fix.

## Repository Contents

The entire analysis can be replicated using the following files provided in this repository:

#### Code (`notebooks/` directory)

1.  **`1_Data_Processing_and_Analysis.ipynb`**: This notebook loads the raw data, performs the core data processing, calculates inequality indices, and generates the intermediate analytical datasets. **This notebook must be run first.**
2.  **`2_Visualization_and_Export.ipynb`**: This notebook loads the processed datasets generated by the first notebook and creates all the figures and tables used in the paper.

#### Raw Data (`data/raw/` directory)

To replicate the work, you will need the following three raw datasets, which should be placed in the `data/raw/` folder:

1.  **`Salarios.csv`**: Contains aggregate salary mass data.
2.  **`Asalariados.csv`**: Contains the number of employees across salary brackets.
3.  **`Retenciones.csv`**: Contains tax withholding data.

## Replication Instructions

1.  **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
2.  **Place the three raw datasets** (`Salarios.csv`, `Asalariados.csv`, `Retenciones.csv`) into the `data/raw/` directory.
3.  **Run the Jupyter Notebooks** in the `notebooks/` directory in sequential order:
    * First, run `1_Data_Processing_and_Analysis.ipynb` to generate the processed data.
    * Second, run `2_Visualization_and_Export.ipynb` to generate the final figures and tables.
